Each lock includes a rigid metal bracket which engages around the extensible part of the leg and is pivotally connected to a crib corner post. The bracket has a nose which projects into one of a series of openings in the extensible part of the leg then the bracket is swung against the leg part to prevent movement of the leg part relative to the post. The upper edge of the bracket is slotted to receive a latch pivotally connected to the corner post just above the bracket. The latch drops into the slot when the nose is engaged in one of the openings so that the bracket cannot be moved. \tA\t0\tHedstrom Co.\t\n",

The container has a structure effective to receive both liquids and gas mediums therein and has valves for introducing and exhausting both liquid and gas mediums. An elongated frame structure has a plurality of parallel linear support members wherein each support member is laterally spaced with respect to any other lateral support member, and a separate end frame portion connected at each end of the support members to form an open structural configuration for receiving the collapsible container. The elongated container is fastened to the frame structure with the longitudinal axis thereof disposed substantially parallel to the linear support members and each of the end surfaces of the container being disposed adjacent an end frame portion to support the container within the frame structure during use. The container is attached to the frame structure with one of the linear support members extending longitudinally along one side of the container with the opposing side of the container being free of a support member. The assembly may be used as a pontoon when the container is inflated with a gas fluid medium and is employable in other uses such as a fresh water reservoir, a ballast, a sea anchor, a pitch and roll stabilizer and the like when the container is not inflated or holdls a liquid fluid medium. \tA\t0\t\tNone\n",

The dogs normally travel in a position to urge an auto through the washer whereat the outboard end is in close association with the chain and beneath the automobile first supporting surface. Operating means are included whereby when an automobile is in position at least one of the dogs will be automatically moved to a position where the dog extends above the automobile supporting surface, contacts a wheel, and urges the car through the washer apparatus. At the wheel spinning and washing station the chain is forced downwardly to a position whereat it passes beneath the mechanism necessary to perform the wheel spinning operation while still retaining the outboard end of the dog above the automobile supporting surface. The continual contact by the dog assures that the automobile moves through the washer apparatus in a continuous motion. \tA\t0\tHaverberg Auto Laundry Equipment Co.\tNone\n",

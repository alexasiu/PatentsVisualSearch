A flame timer is used for controlling the time during which a test piece is exposed to flames from the burner during a cycle. A down-time timer is provided for controlling the time during which the flame is removed from the test piece during a cycle. A heat shield is provided along with means for moving the heat shield between a position intermediate the test piece and the adjacent bunsen burner and a position removed therefrom.

The first switch controls the heat shield and the second switch is coupled to a counter means for deactivating the system after a predetermined number of cycles of operation. PAC BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION 1. Field of the Invention This invention relates to testers for determining combustibility of materials. More particularly, this invention relates to devices using an injection needle, etc., to periodically blow a fine flame onto a test piece for a definite period of time, with a predetermined non-exposure period between flame exposure periods. The operation is repeated to determine the number of cycles required until the test piece begins to burn, to determine whether the test piece catches fire after being subjected to the flame for a predetermined number of cycles, or to inspect combustibility by dividing the time of residual combustion after a number, e.g., five of successive cycles of, e.g., three seconds of flame exposure and, e.g., three seconds down time by the volume lost during the operation. 2. Description of the Prior Art Various flame tests, particularly the last above-noted test, are conducted by hand. In this case, however, human error is unavoidable and results in very poor precision. For example, if the flame was successively applied five times for three seconds each time, i.e., a total of 15 seconds, the error accumulated through human inaccuracy may result in actual flame contact time of as little as 13 seconds or as long as 18 seconds. The flame exposure period commences after the flame of the burner is brought into contact with the test piece. However, certain materials are easily affected or melted by the flame before it is actually brought to the predetermined position and wide variations in test results are obtained when testing these materials. PAC SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION It is an object of the instant invention to provide a new and improved combustion testing system which minimizes error and is automated. It is a further object of the subject invention to provide an improved combustion testing system that will produce accurate results even when easily combustible material is being tested.

The sump oil level control has a small float controlling a relay valve to control an oil level control valve connecting an elevated oil reservoir for gravity feed to fill the sump and pressure return to the reservoir to dump the sump. When the transmission input and pump is not driven, there is no pressure in the chambers at opposite ends of the differential land area level valve and balanced springs hold the level valve in a central closed position blocking flow to and from the reservoir, to the sump and from the pressure line so the oil level control is inoperative. When the transmission input is driven, a small flow of line pressure is supplied through an inlet restriction to each chamber. When the oil level is low, a miniature float provides a small force to close the miniature relay valve closing a restricted exhaust from the chamber at the larger area land so equal pressures in the chambers act on the differential land area to move the level valve to the fill position closing the supply pressure port and providing a full flow connection from the reservoir for gravity feed at a low volume rate of flow to the sump. When the oil level is high the float permits the pressure to open the relay valve and the restricted exhaust reduces the pressure in the larger area chamber to move the level valve to dump position closing the sump port and connecting a restricted supply pressure branch to the reservoir so the transmission pump delivers fluid at the same low volume rate of flow from the sump to the reservoir to reduce the oil level. In a modification a level indicating thermistor controls a solenoid controlled relay valve similarly controlling the oil level valve. ",General Motors Corporation,JamesT.

A motor driven fan is provided in the bottom cold air duct to circulate air through the device. The twin ducts, having interconnecting apertures to the rear, include baffle arrangements to guide the flow of air through the heat exchange tubes for most efficient utilization of the heat from the fire in the fireplace. A forced draft device is incorporated into the cold air duct for selective discharge of air at the base of the fire in the fireplace to facilitate the initial burning of the fuel and to provide a forced draft for proper combustion of the fuel whenever desired. When the fire is first lit, the resulting flames hitting and passing in between and around the overhead heating tubes encircling the fire provide heat almost instantly and as the fire progressively burns, the entire length of the heating tubes, both overhead and encircling the fire on both sides and to the back, become heated providing a continuous expanded volume of hot air which is forced out into the room, away from the fireplace, this air is then circulated and again re-enters the cold air tubes by being forcibly drawn from the floor level and ejected as heated air on the opposite side of the fireplace. This results in an even room temperature, even at floor level. As the fire progressively burns, coals and ashes falling through the apertures in the conventional grate cover the heating tubes extending across the floor of the firepplace thereby extracting heat from this area of the fireplace which becomes heated last, but which also retains heat the longest, long after the fire itself has burned out.

3930496,Cast for broken limbs and method,1/6/76," A cast for broken limbs and related method, the cast comprising a cylindrical, double wall sleeve fabricated of a thin polymeric or elastomeric material and containing a cylindrical batt of fiberglas or like reinforcement impregnated with a polymeric catalyst. The opposed ends of the cast are constructed so that the spaced sleeves are sealed one to another and also to the cylindrical batt of the fiberglas or the like, which is concentrically disposed within the cast intermediate the spaced sleeves. Spacers may be used to maintain said concentric relationship. The cast comprises a plurality of breather ports, the edges of which are sealed as are the ends of the cast. When it is desired to use the cast, a suitable polymeric material is injected through a filler port into the interior of the cast between the two spaced concentric sleeves. The physician manually kneads the resin within the cast causing the catalyst initially contained within the central reinforcement to become mixed into the polymer thereby initiating polymerization. The filling vessel is detached and the cast is placed upon the injured limb of the patient. A conventional wrapping, such as an elastic roll bandage, is placed on the cast to exert pressure causing the same to conform precisely to the exterior surface of the injured limb. The wrapping is removed once the resin has set and adequately cured. PAC BACKGROUND 1. Field of Invention The present invention relates broadly to the art of placing a cast on an injured limb and more particularly to a novel cast comprising a pair of concentric sleeves sealed at the ends and containing therebetween a cylindrical batt of reinforcement impregnated with a resin activating substance which initiates polymerization when comingled with a suitable polymer, and a related method. 2. Prior Art Heretofore, the use of a cast comprising plastic interior and exterior walls have most frequently utilized a polymeric foam in the interior between the sleeves. This has created a number of problems because it is difficult to control the foam and often the cast becomes a pressure-applying device rather than an instrument which restrains undesired movement of the limb. Also, such an approach prevents adequate breathing of the skin in the vicinity of the cast. As a consequence, the medical profession has used only to a limited extent such an approach. PAC BRIEF SUMMARY AND OBJECTS OF THE PRESENT INVENTION With the foregoing in mind, it is a primary object of the present invention to provide a novel cast for injured limbs and related methods. Another paramount object of the present invention is the provision of a novel cast wherein the cast comprises spaced concentric sleeves sealed one to the other at opposed ends and containing therein a cylindrical batt of reinforcement impregnated with a catalyst wherein a polymeric material is injected between the sleeves into contiguous relation with the reinforcement and is caused to be polymerized when mixed with the catalyst. It is a further object of the present invention to provide a novel cast comprising a plurality of breather holes intermediate spaced cylindrical walls of the cast. These and other objects and features of the present invention will be apparent from the following detailed description, taken with reference to the accompanying drawing(s). ",,DelamarJ.

3930752,Oil well pumpoff control system utilizing integration timer,1/6/76," A valve in the production flow line of an oil well closes a reed switch indicative of fluid being pumped through the line. The switch closure activates a first oscillator whose count is compared with a variable frequency oscillator having a frequency of approximately one-half that of the first oscillator. The comparison is made over a given period of time to ascertain the percentage of time the valve has been open and passing fluid. Theoretically, the valve should be open approximately fifty percent of the time because almost that much time is taken on the downstroke of the pumping assembly when no production is occurring. The integrated timer is adjusted to shut down the system when the percentage of time the valve is open drops to the preselected amount, usually equal to or less than around 50 percent. In response to the integration timer producing a signal, a shutdown timer is turned on which restarts the cycle after a preselected amount of time. The length of shutdown time for the pumping unit is preset according to the well fill-in rate. When the system is restarted by the shutdown timer, a pump-up timer is turned on which is adjusted to allow for a desired pump-up time. As the pump-up timer is allowing the system to recycle, the integration timer is reset and the recycling is completed if the requirements of the integration timer are met. Otherwise, the unit is shut down again and the system recycled. A variable electronic scaler is connected to the output of the integration timer which monitors the output signals from this timer. A reset circuit between the integrator and the scaler resets the scaler to zero after a successful recycle of the system. A successful recycle occurs when fluid is pumped at a flow rate equal to or greater than the preset minimum when the pump has been restarted after a shutdown period. If the pumped fluid flow rate achieves the minimum preset flow value during or at the end of the pump-up period, a reset signal is conveyed to the scaler to reset it to zero and continue pump operation and system recycling indefinitely, or until malfunctions interfere with the pumping operation or production drops below a level economically feasible for pumping operations. When malfunctions do occur, such as parting of the sucker rod, the pumped fluid flow rate will remain below the desired preset value and no reset signal will be conveyed to the scaler. At the end of the pump-up cycle the pump will not be pumping fluids and will be shut down in response to the signal from the integrator assembly. Since there will be no reset signal to the scaler, it will begin to accumulate the shutdown signals. After the preset number of times the integration timer produces a shutdown signal, the scaler turns off the whole system. It can then be restarted manually. This provides a safety device for equipment failure such as breaking of the sucker rod. Means are also provided for recording the various timed cycles and also for monitoring the number of signals transmitted to the scaler, thus being indicative of the number of times the system has automatically shut down and successfully recycled. Also a circuit is provided to determine the exact percentage of time that the pump is producing fluid flow, whether above or below the preset minimum percentage. A continuous recorder may be used with this circuit to maintain a constant record of the percentage of time the pump is flowing well fluids to allow the operator to determine if the preset minimum percentage should be lowered, and how much it should be lowered to obtain successful recycling of the pumping system.

3930774,Extruder controller,1/6/76," Thickness of a sheet being produced by an extruder is controlled in response to measurements of: sheet thickness, the speed at which material is fed through a screw of the extruder, as determined by screw speed, and the speed with which material is taken away from the extruder, as determined by sheet speed. Measured thickness is compared with a setpoint for sheet thickness and a determination is made as to whether the thickness is in a predetermined, deadband region relative to the setpoint, or if the sheet is out of the deadband because it is excessively thin or excessively thick. In response to the sheet thickness being in the deadband region, the screw speed is changed in response to a signal indicative of the product of sheet speed error and rate of change of screw speed with respect to sheet speed. Sheet speed is controlled by multiplying sheet speed error by a predetermined constant. In response to the sheet being excessively thin, screw speed, if it has not reached a maximum value, is changed by multiplying sheet thickness error by rate of change of screw speed with respect to sheet thickness; if the screw speed has reached a maximum value, sheet speed is changed by multiplying the thickness error by the rate of change of sheet speed with respect to thickness. In response to the sheet being excessively thick outside of the deadband region and the sheet speed has not reached a predetermined maximum, line speed is changed by multiplying sheet thickness error by the rate of change of sheet speed with respect to sheet thickness; if the line speed has reached the predetermined maximum, screw speed is changed in response to an indication of the product of sheet thickness error and rate of change of screw speed with respect to sheet thickness.

In a continuously flowing system, the biological sample is introduced into a buffered carrier solution of low electrical conductance and is caused to flow into a chamber containing an immobilized enzyme which catalyzes a specific reaction which changes the electrical properties of the solution by increasing the dissociated ion concentration therein. This increase in dissociated ion concentration is directly proportional to the original concentration of urea in the biological sample; and any one of the several conventional electrical measurements may be made to determine the increase in such concentration or the rate of increase in such concentration and thereby determine the concentration of urea in the original biological sample. The buffered carrier solution containing the products of the enzyme-catalyzed reaction is reclaimed by circulating it through a deionization, purification stage in which the solution conductivity is substantially returned to the prereaction value.

3931131,Process and apparatus for suspension polymerization,1/6/76," In a suspension polymerization process which comprises polymerizing an ethylene halide by itself or a mixture of an ethylene halide and a monomer copolymerizable therewith in an aqueous medium in the presence of a suspending agent and an oil-soluble catalyst under pressure, a pressure polymerization vessel the internal exposed surfaces of which are wholly or at least partially lined with wood is used so as to prevent adhesion of the resulting polymer to the exposed area. PAC BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION The present invention relates to a suspension polymerization process in which an ethylene halide or a mixture of an ethylene halide and a monomer copolymerizable therewith is continuously suspension polymerized while adherence of the polymerization component to the wall of the polymerization apparatus is prevented and to a polymerization apparatus therefor. That is, as is well known, in the suspension polymerization of at least one monomer selected from ethylene halides including vinyl chloride, vinyl fluoride, vinylidene chloride, vinylidene fluoride, tetrafluoroethylene, or mixtures thereof or mixtures of an ethylene halide and a monomer copolymerizable therewith in an aqueous medium in the presence of an oil-soluble catalyst and a suspending agent, the resulting polymer adheres to the inner wall of the polymerizatiton vessel and to the internal accessory devices such as agitating vanes, baffle plates, a temperature detector, and the like. This adhesion of the polymer reduces the yield of the polymer and a polymerization temperature adjusting ability and gives rise to problems such as difficulty in adjusting the polymerization temperature and mixing of the adhering material into the product thereby to cause deterioration of the physical properties of the product. Further, there is caused another problem from the standpoint of operation of a polymerization vessel in that removal of the adhering material requires an excessive amount of labor and time, reducing the rate of production. In addition, occurrence and growth of the adhering material is a great obstacle to continuation of the suspension polymerization operation. That is, in order to insure good quality of the product produced by a continuous suspension polymerization process, it is necessary to use a so-called multi-vessel type reactor so as to reduce reverse mixing as much as possible. For this purpose, a passage of a very small area must be formed at least between adjacent vessels, which in turn gives rise to the problem of plugging, whereby normal operation is hindered. It is known that the occurrence of the sticking material depends upon the material from which the polymerization vessel used is made and the content contained in the polymerization vessel. In general, with a polymerization vessel made of stainless steel severe sticking occurs. In the case of a polymerization vessel lined with glass, the degree of sticking is slightly reduced, but when this type of vessel is used, the polymerization vessel must be cleaned after every polymerization operation and, thus, operated by a batch operation. It is not suitable for a continuous operation. Although various attempts have been long made to prevent such sticking, a satisfactory method is still to be found, and this lack is a great obstacle to the continuous operation of the suspension polymerization described above. It is considered that the adhesion of a polymer to the inner wall of the polymerization vessel in the suspension polymerization process is caused by the monomer being first adsorbed on the inner wall and then being polymerized on the surface. In view of this consideration, as one measure for preventing adhesion in the suspension polymerization of the ethylene halide in an aqueous medium, coating of various materials capable of adsorbing water and forming a film of water on the inner wall of the polymerization vessel has been heretofore practiced. However, in all cases, the film of water formed on the surface is composed of a monomolecular layer or at most 20 layers, and this film may be easily removed depending on change in the conditions surrounding the film, whereby it is thus impossible to maintain the film for a long period of time. Therefore, it is possible to attain temporary adhesion prevention using the prior art, but it is almost impossible to expect a continuous effect. PAC SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION It is an object of the present invention to solve the above-mentioned problems of the prior art and to provide a process for the continuous suspension polymerization of the ethylene halides mentioned above and an apparatus therefor. That is, in the suspension polymerization of at least one monomer selected from ethylene halides including vinyl chloride, vinyl fluoride, vinylidene chloride, vinylidene fluoride, tetrafluoroethylene, or mixtures thereof or mixtures of an ethylene halide and a monomer copolymerizable therewith in an aqueous medium containing an oil-soluble catalyst and a suspending agent, polymerization under pressure is carried out in a pressure polymerization vessel in which the whole or at least adhesion susceptive surfaces of the inner wall and accessory instruments contained therein are lined with wood or are constructed of wood. As to the ability of wood to prevent adhesion in the process of the present invention, it is considered that because of its tendency to adsorb water, the wood forms a film of water on the surface thereof which acts as a barrier to a sticking polymer. The wood used in the process of the present invention adsorbs water within the interior thereof and forms a film of water. As compared with the prior method in which a film of water is formed on the inner wall of the polymerization vessel merely using a thin coating of a wettable material, the process of the present invention provides a film of water which is thicker and not easily removed, and, accordingly, adhesion is effectively prevented. Moreover, this effect lasts for a long time. ",Kureha Kagaku Kogyo Kabushiki Kaisha,"Hirotada Tanno,Hiroyuki Noziri,Mituaki Sugahara","3882195,2838380,3842055,3488328,B415124,3849179,3515709"

3931271,Process for the production of secondary alcohol ether sulfates,1/6/76," A process for the production of secondary alcohol ether sulfates which consists essentially of reacting adducts of secondary alkanols having from 6 to 22 carbon atoms adducted with 1 to 10 mols of an alkylene oxide selected from the group consisting of ethylene oxide and propylene oxide, said adduct having at least 1 mol of oxypropylene per mol of alcohol, with at least a molecular equivalent of a sulfating agent stronger than concentrated sulfuric acid at temperatures of from 0.degree.C to 50.degree.C and recovering said secondary alcohol ether sulfate. PAC THE PRIOR ART At present secondary alcohols can be prepared from inexpensive raw materials, such as by oxidation of paraffins, substantially simpler than the preparation of primary alcohols. However, up to now the practical use of secondary alcohols is limited to non-ionic products prepared from them. Surface-active sulfates derived from secondary alcohols are used only in small amounts since the preparation of such raw materials for washing agents is very difficult, because of the instability of the secondary alkylsulfates. Primary alcohols, on the contrary, can be converted simply and with good yields into surface-active sulfates. In the sulfation of secondary alcohols, the conversion rates are low. In order to obtain somewhat usable products, expensive procedures have to be introduced, such as working with solvents and adduct formers, use of special sulfating agents, such as, for example, amidosulfonic acid, etc., as well as the addition of ethylene oxide adducts of primary alcohols. On the other hand, there is the possibility that by reaction of secondary alcohols with ethylene oxide, adducts with primary hydroxyl groups can be prepared, the sulfation products of which could be expected to have greater stability. It is, however, very difficult to prepare ethoxylates of secondary alcohols with a high conversion rate and small amounts of by-products. A higher conversion rate of the secondary alcohols with ethylene oxide can only be attained by relatively cumbersome procedures, such as, for example, a two-step ethoxylation in which in the first step an acidic catalyst is used and, after distilling off the unreacted secondary alcohol, in the second step an alkaline catalyst is utilized. However, the ethoxylated secondary alcohols obtained by this expensive procedure are also unsatisfactorily sulfated and can only be sulfated by the application of special procedures. This is difficult to explain since by the ethoxylation of secondary alcohols, adducts with primary hydroxyl groups were formed. PAC OBJECTS OF THE INVENTION An object of the present invention is the development of a simple process for the production of secondary alcohol ether sulfates utilizing conventional strong sulfating agents to give products with a high degree of sulfation. Another object of the invention is the development of a process for the production of secondary alcohol ether sulfates which consists essentially of reacting adducts of secondary alkanols having from 6 to 22 carbon atoms adducted with 1 to 10 mols of an alkylene oxide selected from the group consisting of ethylene oxide and propylene oxide, said adduct having at least 1 mol of oxypropylene per mol of alcohol, with at least a molecular equivalent of a sulfating agent stronger than concentrated sulfuric acid at temperatures of from 0.degree.C to 50.degree.C and recovering said secondary alcohol ether sulfate. These and other objects of the invention will become more apparent as the description thereof proceeds. PAC DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION It has now been surprisingly found that alkylene oxide adducts of secondary alcohols which contain at least one propylene glycol ether group can be sulfated simply with a high conversion rate. This result was the more unexpected since, as is known, on the introduction of propylene glycol ether groups by propoxylation, adducts with predominately secondary hydroxyl groups are formed. Therefore, the same difficulties in the further reaction of these adducts, especially in sulfation, would be expected as in the sulfation of secondary alcohols themselves. With this expectation, the sulfation of secondary alcohol propoxylates would appear to the expert as having little prospect of good yields. The invention relates, therefore, to a process for the preparation of surface-active ether and polyether sulfates which is characterized in that adducts of secondary alkanols having 6 to 22 carbon atoms adducted with 1 to 10 mols of alkylene oxide, possessing in the average at least 1 mol of propylene oxide per mol of alcohol, are reacted in a known manner at temperatures between 0.degree.C and 50.degree.C, particularly from 10.degree.C and 30.degree.C, with strong sulfating agents in at least stoichiometric amounts. As starting materials those adducts may be used that were obtained (1) by ethoxylation of secondary alcohols in the first step and subsequent propoxylation of the reaction mixtures, or (2) by reaction of secondary alcohols with ethylene oxide/propylene oxide mixtures, or (3) by the ethoxylation of reaction mixtures of secondary alcohols with propylene oxide, or (4) by pure propoxylation of secondary alcohols. The preferred starting materials are the adducts of propylene oxide to secondary alcohols or secondary alkanol propoxylates having 6 to 22 carbon atoms in the alkanol and 1 to 10 oxypropylene units. The mixed alkoxylates to be used contain preferably 1 to 4, particularly 2 to 3, oxyethylene groups. Of particular advantage among the pure propylene oxide adducts are those substance mixtures which were obtained by reaction of 1.5 to 5 mols of propylene oxide with 1 mol of secondary alcohol. The starting materials can be obtained by conventional alkoxylation methods. The alkoxylation can be carried out both anionically, in the presence of alkaline alkoxylation catalysts, such as alkali metal hydroxides or alkali metal alcoholates, particularly sodium, potassium and lithium lower alkanolates, and cationically in the presence of acidic catalysts, such as BF.sub.3, or in the presence of the tertiary oxonium salts described as alkoxylation catalysts in Belgian Pat. No. 715,048. If mixed adducts are used which have been obtained by propoxylation of ethylene oxide adducts of secondary alcohols as starting materials, such mixed adducts are preferred in which the alkoxylation in the first step was carried out by a cationic catalyst and in the second step with an anionic catalyst. Among the mixed adducts which are obtained by simultaneous addition of ethylene oxide and propylene oxide, or by propoxylation in the first step and ethoxylation in the second step, as well as in the pure propoxylation products, these are preferably prepared by reaction with an anionic catalyst. The secondary alcohols utilized to prepare the alkoxylation mixtures can be either compounds of uniform chain length or mixtures of homologs. Of particular economic advantage are those alcohol mixtures which have been obtained by the oxidation of paraffins in the presence of boron compounds, such as, for example, boric acid, boron trioxide, borates, boric acid esters, as well as other known reagents for the formation of secondary alcohols, such as arsenic acid, arsenic acid esters, arsenic trioxide, and others. The alkoxylation mixtures utilizable for the subsequent sulfation can be used as crude products, that is, without intervening purification or processing operations. This is of essential importance for the technical execution of the process. These crude alkoxylation mixtures contain, therefore, in addition to the desired alkylene oxide adducts of secondary alcohols, as secondary constituents, the corresponding alkylene and/or polyalkylene glycols as well as, possibly, non-reacted secondary alcohol. The sulfation of the alkoxylate mixture is preferably carried out in the temperature range of from 10.degree.C to 30.degree.C. By ""strong sulfating agents"" are meant those which are stronger than concentrated sulfuric acid, for example, SO.sub.3 or SO.sub.3 /air mixtures, oleum, chlorosulfonic acid, and the like. The addition of adduct formers for the sulfating agent or the presence of solvents are not required in the process. The preferred sulfating agent is chlorosulfonic acid. The mol ratio between the alkoxylate and the sulfating agent is advantageously chosen in the range of from 1:1.0 to 1:1.2, particularly in the range of from 1:1.02 to 1:1.1. The sulfation reaction can be carried out continuously or discontinuously. The reaction times lie between fractions of seconds to about 20 minutes, depending upon the sulfating agent and/or sulfating apparatus used. Particularly short reaction times are attained if the reaction is carried out with very strong sulfating agents, such as SO.sub.3 /air mixtures, in modern short-time sulfation reactors which operate by the split-ring or falling film principle. The products of the process have a substantially higher degree of sulfation than the products obtained by the sulfation of technical ethylene oxide adducts of secondary alcohols. They have, without further processing, very good surface-active properties and are superior, particularly in regard to their wetting action, to the known commercial sulfated adducts of ethylene oxide to primary alcohols. The advantages attainable with the invention consist primarily in that as a raw material source for surface-active, water-soluble sulfates, secondary alcohols have been made available. Particularly those secondary alcohols which are easily obtainable by paraffin oxidation in the presence of the above-named oxidation catalysts to produce secondary alcohols with statistically distributed hydroxyl groups. These alcohols are converted by alkoxylation to the substances suitable for sulfation. Thus, these petrochemical raw materials can form the basis for the desired surface-active substances. Anionic active derivatives of secondary alcohols were up to now technically not producible by a simple way although secondary alcohols have been produced for some time on a large scale. The use of secondary alcohols was, therefore, until now limited to the production of non-ionic substances. A further advantage of the process according to the invention can be seen in that the necessary alkoxylation may be carried out without a large expense in regard to catalysts and/or equipment. The following examples are illustrative of the invention without being deemed limitative in any respect.
